As more consumers seek to reduce their consumption of animal-derived products due to dietary preferences or ethical reasons, almond products like almond milk and almond butter have emerged as leading choices in the plant-based food segment. The non-dairy milk segment is one of the fastest-growing categories in the market, with almond milk emerging as a top contender due to its versatility, taste, and nutritional benefits. The snacking category is also experiencing significant growth, with almonds being used in a variety of convenient snack forms like almond-based protein bars, roasted almonds, and almond-flavored beverages.
